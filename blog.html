        Hi, everyone. This page is dedicated to myself and all the work I put into making websites!
        The beginning of my journey into making websites first started with me going to Digital Crafts.
        Before class begun, we had alot of prework to do, which included going to Codecademey.com to make sure
        that.
      </p>
    <form action="/action_page.php">

      <textarea id="blogText" name="blogText" rows="12" cols="30" aria-placeholder="Type what you experienced today..." maxlength="1000">
      This is part of my blog and will help make sure I get a chance to type everything I go through in the Boot camp for everyone to see!
